            <h1>What is WishList about?</h1>
            <u><h3>Our Goal:</h3></u>
            <p>Many shopping websites have a wish list specific to their website, but there is no service that provides an overarching wishlist that can store all of your desired products all in one place. The goal of wishList is to consolidate all of your wish lists from different sites into one!</p>
            <h2>Instead of sending 5 wish lists, send one!</h2>
